### Welcome!
This Emacs "distro" is based on my personal Emacs configuration (on GNU Emacs 26.2). It's unopinionated and was created for general use in mind. I've documented, as detailed as possible, what **each code snippet does** in my `config.org` file.

You can find my opinionated personal configuration here: https://github.com/ianpan870102/.use-package.emacs.d

This Emacs config starts up **super fast** with an average init time of 0.7 second.

### Installation
Back up your `~/.emacs.d/` first (if you have one):

```mv ~/.emacs.d/ ~/.emacs.d.bak/```

Git clone my configuration to your new `~/.emacs.d/` :

```git clone https://github.com/ianpan870102/.emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d/```

### "Rolling" Release
I will constantly push new commits as soon as I discover new things suitable for this "distro"

### How the config structure works

The `init.el` requires `config.el`, which is produced by org-babel and `config.org`. This allows me to put most of my configuration in an Org file with literate programming style (good for documenting code usage!).

### Packages that I use:

#### Package manager
- use-package

#### Vim editing habits (optional depending on your preferences)
- evil
- evil-commentary
- evil-magit

#### Git integration
- magit

#### Better Emacs defaults
- company (auto-completion)
- ido-vertical-mode
- ido-completing-read+ (ido-ubiquitous)
- yasnippets & yasnippet-snippets
- dashboard (welcome screen)

#### Org mode
- org-bullets

#### Friendly warnings
- flycheck

#### Lightweight syntax highlight improvement for all languages
- highlight-operators
- highlight-numbers
- highlight-escape-sequences

### Appendix I: Themes I adore
- Spacemacs Dark & Light: https://github.com/nashamri/spacemacs-theme
- Gruvbox Dark: https://github.com/Greduan/emacs-theme-gruvbox
- Nord: https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-emacs
- Monochrome: https://github.com/fxn/monochrome-theme.el
- Zenburn: https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs

If you prefer a theme pack with some of the most popular themes, I recommend the emacs-doom-themes package
- Doom-themes package: https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes

### Wilmersdorf Theme
The default installation of my Emacs configuration ships with the Wilmersdorf theme I made myself.
It is inspired by Monochrome, Spacemacs Dark, Ariake Dark, and Raiju.
You can find more information on the theme here: https://github.com/ianpan870102/Emacs-Wilmersdorf-Theme

### Appendix II: Fonts I adore
- Source Code Pro (playful and modern-looking, easy on the eyes)
- Droid Sans Mono (slick and elegant)
- Menlo / DejaVu family (classic, default on lots of systems)
- Input Mono (customizable, easy on the eyes)

### FAQ:
#### 1. But I'm not an Evil user
- Go ahead and delete the couple of lines regarding the Evil section in `config.org`, or simply remove the function call to `(evil-mode)`. Then uninstall the package for good.
#### 2. Why does my font look wrong?
- You might not have the required fonts installed, feel free to install them or change the font settings to your own liking in `config.org` (via the `set-frame-font` function)

#### 3. How can I install extra packages that I want?
You should be able to install packages the normal way (`M-x list-packages RET` and `i x` on the desired package row). If you plan to sync your config files across machines, add the configuration in `config.org` with your preferred syntax (use-package is recommended). Yay-Evil sets all the packages `:ensure` to true by default, so you don't need to add `:ensure t`.

#### 4. How can I remove packages that I don't need?
For this you need two steps:
- First, type `M-x list-packages RET` in Emacs bindings (or `:list-packages RET` in Evil Normal state) and delete the unwanted package by placing your cursor on the row and press `d` followed by an `x`.
- Next, in the `config.org` file, remove (or comment out) the relevant configuration code.
